# Boston Schools and Crime Rates
Some Boston public schools have more underperforming students and dropout incidents than others. These outcomes can be perceived to be 
caused by factors such as physical ability, cognitive ability, motivation, family background, and race. However, there is an increasing 
number of articles indicating forced drop outs leading to increased crime rate. In order to gain understanding based on evidence, we 
would like to investigate external factors, specifically crime rates in the surrounding neighborhood and the corresponding academic 
performances. The scope of our project will include dropout rates and standardized test scores for each public school in Boston, and 
comparison to rates of various types of crimes in different neighborhoods. These findings could give insight into the relationship between 
crime rates, dropout rates, and MCAS scores.
